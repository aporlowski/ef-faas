1. Deployable memory size is limited to 2GB. Data and models that exceed this limit will not be able to execute
2. Timeout limited to 540s. If the service can not complete in this time, it cannot be run as faas
3. Development can be slow as environment differences between local and the cloud service can cuase errors. Re-deploying the faas to test a fix can take upto 2 mins, compared to rerunning nstantly on the local machine. yea, but so can cloudmesh...
4. environment variables USER was not found
5. have to understand and work with REST framework i.e. python flask request objects and response objects. FIle upload was particularly challenging.
6. not really self documenting like openapi but checkout https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/get-started-cloud-functions
7. go automatic genereate GUI, will have to roll my own
8. vendor lock in
9. had to learn a storage API
10. extract moved from download funciton to train function for efficient storage and transfer of data from object storage to function instance
instead of extracting it does have to push the data to cloud storage
